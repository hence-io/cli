Command | Description
--- | ---
<br>[machine](./machine.md)<br><br> | <br>Create and manage Hence.io Machines.  Currently limitied to local VM's, but remote Machine functionality is coming soon.<br><br>
<br>[compose](./compose.md)<br><br> | <br>Run rancher-compose commands against any machine.  The `project` command will encompass what this does and more, but this is very useful if you'd like to experiment with on-off stacks without creating Hence Projects out of them.<br><br>
<br>[project](./project.md)<br><br> | <br>**_(coming soon)_** Create and manage Hence.io Projects.  Allows easy definition of Hence Projects, and running them on any active Machines.<br><br>
